EJS, or Embedded JavaScript templating, is a templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It's a great tool for building dynamic web pages from templates. Here's a basic guide on how to use EJS in an Express application.

Step 1: Set Up Express
First, ensure you have EJS installed in your project. If you haven't installed them yet, you can do so by running:

npm install ejs

Step 2: Create Your Express App
In your project directory, create a file named app.js (or any name you prefer). Here's a simple Express setup that uses EJS:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Set EJS as the templating engine
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// A route that renders an EJS view
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Hello EJS', message: 'Welcome to EJS!' });
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`));

Step 3: Create Your EJS View
Inside your project, create a directory named views. Inside views, create a file named index.ejs. This will be your EJS template for the / route. Here's a basic example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title><%= title %></title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1><%= message %></h1>
</body>
</html>

In this index.ejs file, <%= title %> and <%= message %> are placeholders that EJS replaces with the values you pass from your Express route (res.render('index', { title: 'Hello EJS', message: 'Welcome to EJS!' });).


Explanation
EJS uses <% %> tags to embed JavaScript into HTML. There are a few different tags you can use:

<%= %>: Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)
<%- %>: Outputs the unescaped value into the template (useful for including raw HTML)
<% %>: Runs JavaScript code but does not output anything

This setup allows you to create dynamic templates based on the data you pass to res.render from your routes, enabling the generation of HTML content on the fly.
