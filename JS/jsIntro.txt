Javascript
=> Javascript is a programming language designed to interact with elements of web pages. 
=> It was founded by Brendan Eich
=> It has three main parts,
1. ECMAscript - It provides the core functionality
2. Document Object Model (DOM) - It provides interfaces for interacting with the elements of web pages
3. Browser Object Model (BOM) - It provides browser API for interacting with the web browsers
=> Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language - executes line by line

Execution Context
=> everything in js happens inside the execution context.
=> when a js code starts executing it creates a global execution context.
=> It has 2 phases --> 
1. memory creation phase - it allocates memory
2. code execution phase - it executes line by line
=> whenever a new fnc is invoked, new execution context is created. once the fnc is returned the execution context gets deleted.
=> Call stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts.
