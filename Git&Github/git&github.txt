--> git - It is a software tool for version control
    -> version control - to keep track of code 

--> github - to host the local git repositories in online

--> git clone - to take the existing repo, clone it & use it locally 
syntax: git clone <url>
eg: git clone https://github.com/imsanga/test-project.git

--> git add: which adds the file u need to track 
syntax: git add <filename>
eg: git add add.js
   -> to add all the files u need to track - git add .

--> git commit - commit the code to the local repo
syntax: git commit -m "msg"
eg: git commit -m "added the addition functionality"

--> to commit all the files which u changed [shrtCut] [note: only the already tracked files]
syntax: git commit -am "msg"
eg: git commit -am "added the addition functionality"

--> git status - gives the current status of the repo  
syntax: git status

--> git push - it pushes the code from local repo to github repo  
syntax: git push

--> git pull - it pulls the code from github repo to local repo
syntax: git pull

--> Merge conflicts - In a scenario where Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
// Merge conflicts happen when two branches modify the same part of a file differently. Resolving them involves manually editing the file to select the final version, then staging and committing the resolved file.

--> git reset - to reset with already commited code
syntax: git reset --hard <commitHash>
eg: git reset --hard 6ef3bc195438df824ebac884a6b37bc6c8b7a64e
syntax: reset branch -> git reset --hard <origin/branchName>
eg: git reset --hard main

--> Branching - to avoid linear approach which makes hard to debug errors, we use branching.
 -> to show all the branch use - git branch

--> create new branch
syntax: git checkout -b "branchName" || git branch <branchName>
eg: git checkout -b "newBranch" || git branch newBranch

--> push a new branch 
syntax: git push origin <branchName>
eg: git push origin newBranch 

--> to shift to already created branch
syntax: git checkout <branchname>
eg: git checkout main

--> merge - to merge the code changes from one branch to other
syntax: git merge <branchname>
eg: git merge newBranch

--> pull request - to notify the project team that i have made some changes in the code base in my branch and need to push it to main branch.
