Streams
* Streams are sequence of data that is being moved from one point to another over a time.
eg: stream of data is moved over the internet from one computer to another
*Stream of data is proccessed in chunks as they arrive instead of waiting for the entire data to arrive and proccess it
* It improves memory efficiency & performance

Buffers
* It is a temporary storage area that nodejs maintains during the runtime where chunks gets stored

flow
* data received is read in chunks and stored in buffer
* once the buffer as enough data to process, event is triggered 
* Event's callback function is placed to callback queue by eventloop
* once the callstack is empty the eventloop sends the callback function to callstack
