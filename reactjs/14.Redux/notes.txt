actions is a object which has action creators which is used for dispatching

reducer is a function that updates the store with update state


function reducer(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "todoFeature/addToDo":
      return [...state, action.payload];
      
    case "todoFeature/removeToDo":
      return state.filter((_, index) => index !== action.payload);

    default:
      return state;
  }
}




action is dispatched 
dispatch function sends action to store
store forwards action to reducer 
reducer updates the state
store notifies the component via useSelector
component is re rendered with the updated state



The useDispatch hook returns dispatch function, which is used to send actions to the Redux store.

The useSelector hook allows components to extract data from the Redux store.
